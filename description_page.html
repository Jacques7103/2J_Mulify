                <p class="content2">About :<br>“Heat Waves” is the fourth single from UK band Glass Animals' third studio album Dreamland.
                    The song features a melancholy tone but maintains high energy through its instrumental, with Dave speaking
                    on remaining strong through vulnerable moments in your life and embracing your vulnerability.
                    <br><br>
                    The band first teased the track along their 2020 Déjà Vu Tour, as seen on the setlist for the Toronto show
                     on the tour. Dave then teased the song’s release and chorus lyrics on the band’s subreddit on June 26, 2020.
                     It was later premiered as Annie Mac’s Hottest Record in the World on BBC Radio 1 on June 29, 2020.</p>

Road shimmer
Wiggling the vision
Heat heat waves
I'm swimming in a mirror

Road shimmer
Wiggling the vision
Heat heat waves
I'm swimming in a

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

Usually I put
Something on TV
So we never think
About you and me

But today I see
Our reflections
Clearly in Hollywood
Laying on the screen

You just need a better life than this
You need something I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now the night has come but

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

You can't fight it
You can't breathe
You say something so loving but
Now I've got to let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too

You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

I just wonder what you're dreaming of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Heat waves been faking me out

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

Road shimmer
Wiggling the vision
Heat heat waves
I'm swimming in a mirror

Road shimmer
Wiggling the vision
Heat heat waves
I'm swimming in a mirror
