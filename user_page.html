        <h2>The 1975</h2>
        <p class="description-1">The 1975 consists of Matthew Healy (vocals/guitar), Adam Hann (lead guitar), George Daniel (drums), and Ross MacDonald (bass), all of whom are from Macclesfield in Cheshire, England. The four band members, now based in Manchester, met in Secondary School and began playing together as teenagers.</p>
        <p class="description-1">The eclectic four-piece band have amorphous drifts between brooding art rock, crisp electronica, dancefloor R&B, and 80’s gloss pop, as well as lead singer Matthew “Matty” Healy’s stories of lust, intoxication, and the unabashed grittiness of modern youth. Common themes in their lyrics range anywhere from dysfunctional relationships, to the failure of modernity.</p>
        <p class="description-1">Throughout 2012, The 1975 released multiple EPs, which sparked the start of their careers. The following year, 2013, their self-titled debut album took the world by storm. From 2014 until 2015 the band’s focus was on touring, though they did reveal through photos on social media that their next sound would reflect a departure from their previously black-and-white aesthetic.</p>
